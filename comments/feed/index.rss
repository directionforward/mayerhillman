					<description><![CDATA[When it come to the helmet debate I think I tick a lot of boxes, I&#039;m a dual national, New Zealand/Netherlands but I live in the U.K. where I had a head injury while riding my bike.

I was raised in New Zealand, and like many children cycled to school in my case from the age of seven. Continued to cycle to high school and university and to my place of work. I used to cycle across the same road where Aaron Oaten was hit and severely brain damaged and whose mother Rebecca went on a crusade for a mandatory helmet law.
I have also lived and worked in the Netherlands where a traditional Dutch bike was my main mode of transport.
After moving to London and I didn&#039;t cycle for over a decade. But on returning to cycling I felt &quot;10 years younger&quot;.
While riding home at night I was hit by a car. So severely that I &#039;woke up&#039; in the ambulance 40 minutes later. My face now has 8 titanium plates, I wasn&#039;t wearing a helmet but have no brain damage. This puzzled me and made me think as to how hard you need to actually be hit in order to get a brain injury.
Since I had no memory of the accident therefore no mental trauma I continued to cycle, ironically because I had a foot injury I couldn&#039;t walk far so I cycled even more.
I joined the CTC (Cycle Touring Club) and go for rides whenever possible.

Several months ago I rode around Europe with a friend on a 3 week tour of the Netherlands Germany Belgium and France, 1400 kms in total.

On holiday to New Zealand turned out to be a disappointment. In the quadrangle of my old high school where there had once been enough racks for a thousand bicycles was now a car park. I learned that after the helmet law had came in my sisters and Dutch aunt immediately gave up cycling. 

According to an online book the the modal share for bicycles in my city was 13.2% and for schoolchildren in another but similarly flat city was 77%, now all gone.

It was websites such as yours that reinforced my instincts on the matter of helmets.

By the way I live in Neasden, I would love to meet up with you.]]></description>
